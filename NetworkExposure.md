# Network Exposure

## Networking background
    Networking is all about communicating between processes that may or may notshare the same local resources. To understand the material in this chapter you onlyneed to consider a few basic network abstractions that are commonly used by processes. The better understanding you have of networking, the more you’ll learn about the mechanics at work. But a deep understanding isn’t required to use the tools provided by Docker. If anything, the material contained herein should prompt you to independently research selected topics as they come up. Those basic abstractions used by processes include protocols, network interfaces, and ports.
